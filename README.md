I am an Android and Backend Developer with experience in creating mobile applications (Android Mobile and TV), focusing on Java and Kotlin, and backend development using PHP and SQL. I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at IFSP Campinas. I have also studied Information Security at Anhanguera and hold technical degrees in Systems Development (SENAI Zerbini) and Graphic Design (SAGA Campinas).

I have knowledge and hands-on experience in developing Android applications (Mobile and TV), API integration, backend development with PHP and SQL, and app deployment to the Play Store, App Store, and Smart TVs (Tizen/webOS). I work with version control using Git and cloud services integration with Firebase (Realtime Database, Authentication, and Crashlytics).

I have participated in various projects, both personal and professional, applying agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, always with a strong focus on quality, innovation, and continuous improvement.
